# Webserver.py - Responding to Multiple GET Requests
We have a server that can say "Hello!". So now let's add some more functionality to it. Most modern websites have more than just one page, so let's figure out how to add this feature to our web server. In this section, we will see that our server can handle different types of GET requests, and respond with different types of messages.

## Code Breakdown
Instead of replying with "Hello!", let's make a page that also replies in Spanish when we visit the hola URL. To do this, let's copy our `if` block from before and past it bellow, like so:
```
...

class webserverHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        try:
            if self.path.endswith("/hello"):
                self.send_response(200)
                self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')
                self.end_headers()

                output = ""
                output += """
                    <html>
                        <body>
                            Hello!
                        </body>
                    </html>
                """
                self.wfile.write(output)
                print output
                return

            if self.path.endswith("/hola"):
                self.send_response(200)
                self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')
                self.end_headers()

                output = ""
                output += """
                    <html>
                        <body>
                            &#161Hola!
                            <a href='/hello'>Back to Hello</a>
                        </body>
                    </html>
                """
                self.wfile.write(output)
                print output
                return

        except IOError:
            self.send_error(404, "File Not Found %s" % self.path)
...
```
We just changed the message that said _hello_ in English to _hola_ in Spanish, using this special entity code `&#161` that HTML will render as an upside-down exclamation point.

We also added an anchor tag to link back to our original hello page, just so we can see how that's done here.

## Running webserver.py
Now we're ready to try and run this and see what happens. On your terminal, type:
```
$ python webserver.py
```
And hit enter. On your browser, access **localhost:8080/hola**.

Now we have two URLs we can visit, each rendering a unique page to our browser.
