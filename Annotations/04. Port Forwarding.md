The **[Vagrant File](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm/blob/master/vagrant/Vagrantfile)** provided in this repository looks something like this:

```
VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"

Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
    config.vm.provision "shell", path: "pg_config.sh"
    #   config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise32"
    config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty32"
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8000, host: 8000
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 5000, host: 5000
end
```
Port forwarding allows us to open pages in our browser from the web server from our virtual machine as if they were being run locally.

If you want to use another port, you can add another line to the vagrant file on your host machine. More information about por forwarding is available **[here](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/forwarded_ports.html)**.
