# Form requests and redirects

We know that with HTTP there are various types of requests that we can send along with URL. By default, a route in Flask only answers to get requests. But that can be changed by providing the methods argument inside the route decorator.

We will change our route to create a new item, such that it responds to GET and POST requests, like so:
```
@app.route('restaurants/<int:restaurant_id>/new', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
```
Now that we can respond to POST requests, we can make forms for creating and updating menu items.

We will make a new template called newMenuItem.html, like so:
```
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset='utf-8'>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>New Menu Item</h1>
        <form action="{{ url_for('newMenuItem', restaurant_id=restaurant.id) }}" method="post">
            <p>Name:</p>
            <input type='text' size='30' name='name'>
            <input type='submit' value='Create'>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```
Take a second to look over the code. Here, we're making a small form with only one entry to create a new menu item name.

In order to get data from the form, we will import `request` from our Flask package like so:
```
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
```
in our `project.py` file.

Inside our `newMenuItem` function, we will create an if statement that looks for a POST request.

We can create a new menu item like so:
```
@app.route('/restaurant/<int:restaurant_id>/new/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def newMenuItem(restaurant_id):
★    if request.method == 'POST':
★        newItem = MenuItem(name = request.form['name'], restaurant_id = restaurant_id)
★        session.add(newItem)
★        session.commit()
     return "page to create a new menu item. Task 1 complete!"
```
And extract the *name* field from our form using `request.form`.

After we create the menu item, we can then add it to our session and commit the session to the database.

To redirect the user back to the main user page, we can use a helper function called redirect, like so:
```
@app.route('/restaurant/<int:restaurant_id>/new/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def newMenuItem(restaurant_id):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        newItem = MenuItem(name = request.form['name'], restaurant_id = restaurant_id)
        session.add(newItem)
        session.commit()
★       return redirect(url_for('restaurantMenu', restaurant_id = restaurant_id))

```
You should remember to import `redirect` and `url_for` in order to enable this functionality in our project:
```
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
```
Now we need to properly handle the GET request for creating a new menu item. If our server didn't receive a POST request, it's going to go ahead and render the template for the new HTML template that we created to create a new menu item, passing in the restaurant_id as well:
```
@app.route('/restaurant/<int:restaurant_id>/new/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def newMenuItem(restaurant_id):
★    if request.method == 'POST':
         newItem = MenuItem(name =  request.form['name'], restaurant_id = restaurant_id)
         session.add(newItem)
         session.commit()
         return redirect(url_for('restaurantMenu', restaurant_id = restaurant_id))
★    else:
★        return render_template('newMenuItem.html', restaurant_id = restaurant_id)
```
Make sure to add a link to the `menu.html` file to actually get to the New Menu Item page. Remember that the restaurant object has been passed into the template, so we have access to its details:
```
<a href = "{{ url_for('newMenuItem', restaurant_id = restaurant_id) }}">Create New Item</a>
```
Now, when we click Create New Item it takes us to the New Menu Item page and we have successfully created a new menu item.

Quiz

Now, it's your turn to make a form in Flask. Create a template called editMenuItem.html that allows us to edit the name of a specific menu item. A major difference between this form and the *new menu* form is that now you should find the item you want to edit and pass that in with the render template function. Use the placeholder tag in HTML so that the user sees the information that they're about to modify. Also, add a link called Cancel that will take us back to the main menu page if we decide we don't want to modify a menu item.

**[Here](https://github.com/udacity/Full-Stack-Foundations/tree/master/Lesson-3/12_Edit-Menu-Form)** you can find a project.py file that already has the editMenuItem function filled out, so you just need to create the form that will communicate with it.

```
@app.route('/restaurants/<int:restaurant_id>/<int:menu_id>/edit/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def editMenuItem(restaurant_id, menu_id):
    editedItem = session.query(MenuItem).filter_by(id = menu_id).one()
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if request.form['name']:
            editedItem.name = request.form['name']
            session.add(editedItem)
            session.commit()
            return redirect(url_for('restaurantMenu', restaurant_id = restaurant_id))
        else:
            return render_template('editmenuitem.html', restaurant_id = restaurant_id, menu_id = menu_id, item = editedItem)
```

## Solution

Inside our editMenuItem function, we see that in our render_template we're passing in three variables that our editmenuitem.html is going to have access to:

```
else:
    return render_template('editmenuitem.html', restaurant_id = restaurant_id, menu_id = menu_id, item = editedItem)
```
So to edit a new menu item, we're going to create a form, just like we did when we created a new menu item. Inside the form we're going to call our editMenuItem function with the appropriate parameters.
```
<form action="{{ url_for('editMenuItem', restaurant_id = restaurant_id, menu_id=item.id) }}"
```
Next, we'll prompt for the name of the new menu item and create an input field. Using the placeholder attribute of HTML we can have that field already filled out with the name of the item we're going to edit, like so:
```
<form action="{{ url_for('editMenuItem', restaurant_id=restaurant_id, menu_id = item.id) }}" method="post">
     <p>Name:</p>
★    <input type='text' size='30' name='name' placeholder='{{item.name}}'>
</form>
```
We'll then add a button called 'Edit' and a link to cancel just in case we realize we actually don't want to edit our menu item:
```
<form action="{{ url_for('editMenuItem', restaurant_id=restaurant_id, menu_id = item.id) }}" method="post">
     <p>Name:</p>
     <input type='text' size='30' name='name' placeholder='{{item.name}}'>
★    <input type='submit' value='Edit'>
★    <a href="{{ url_for('restaurantMenu', restaurant_id=item.restaurant_id) }}">Cancel/a>
</form>
```
When we save and run, we see that we can now change the name of our menu items. The solution code for this lesson is available **[here](https://github.com/udacity/Full-Stack-Foundations/blob/master/Lesson-3/13_Edit-Menu-Form-Solution/editmenuitem.html)**.
