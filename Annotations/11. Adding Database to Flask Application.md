# Adding Database to Flask Application

So now that we have a functioning Flask application, let's bring our CRUD functionality into it. We will import the code for SQLAlchemy and the database engine in sessionmaker like in Lessons 1 and 2.

 ```
 from flask import Flask
 app = Flask(__name__)

 ★ from sqlalchemy import create_engine
 ★ from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
 ★ from database_setup import Base, Restaurant, MenuItem

 ★ engine = create_engine('sqlite:///restaurantmenu.db')
 ★ Base.metadata.bind = engine

 ★ DBSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
 ★ session = DBSession()

 @app.route('/')
 @app.route('/hello')
 def HelloWorld():
     return "Hello World"

 if __name__ == '__main__':
     app.debug = True
     app.run(host = '0.0.0.0', port = 5000)
 ```
Now we're going to change our HelloWorld function such that it performs a query to grab the first restaurant out of our database and list out all of the menu items and stored them in a string called output, like so:
```
def HelloWorld():
★   restaurant = session.query(Restaurant).first()
★   items = session.query(MenuItem).filter_by(restaurant_id = restaurant.id)
★   output = ''
★   for i in items:
★       output += i.name
★       output += '</br>'
★   return output
```
We also insert a break line to make the output easier to read. We `return` the output string so that our user sees it from the browser.

When we save our Python file our Flask server instantly refreshes itself. So when we refresh the page, we now see all of our menu items listed.
