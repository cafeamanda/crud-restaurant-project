# About webserver.py
This code is divided in 2 main sections: the **main()** method and the **handler** class. In **main** we instantiate the server and specify what port it'll listen on. The **handler** code indicates what code to execute based on the type of HTTP request that is sent to the server.

## Code Breakdown

```
from BaseHTTPServer import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

...
```
**class *BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)*** builds on the TCPserver class *(which indicates the transmission protocol that this server will use)* by storing the server address as instance variables named server_name and server_port *(server_address is a tuple, that contains the host and port number for the server)*. The server is accessible by the handler, tipically through the handler's server instance variable.

**class *BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler(request, client_address, server)*** is used to handle the HTTP requests that arrive at the server. By itself, it cannot respond to any actual HTTP requests; it must be subclassed to handle each request method (e.g. GET or POST). BaseHTTPRequestHandler provides a number of class and instance variables, and methods for use by subclasses.

We start by coding a main method as the **entry point** of this code:
```
...

def main():

...
```
This next block of code is added **at the end** of the file to **immediately run the main method** when the Python interpreter executes the script.
```
...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
A try-except block is added inside the main method, like so:
```
...

def main():
    try:

    except:

...
```
The Python interpreter will try to attempt the code inside the try block, and if a defined event occurs, we can exit out of the code with an exception. The exception we want to handle is ***KeyboardInterrupt***. This is a built-in exception in Python that can be triggered when the user holds Ctrl+C on the keyboard.
```
...

def main():
    try:

    except KeyboardInterrupt:

...
```
An instance of the HTTPServer class is created inside the try block, like so:
```
...

def main():
    try:
        port = 8080
        server = HTTPServer(('', port), webserverHandler)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:

...
```
The host is left as an empty string and the port number is specified with an integer.

Notice that it's the first time that **webserverHandler** appears in this code. We will define this request handler later. First, let's add some finishing code to the main method.

After creating the server, we'll add a print statement to know that our server is running. Then, we will use the **serve_forever** function built into our HTTPServer to keep it constantly listening until the user calls Ctrl+C or exits the application.
```
...

def main():
    try:
        port = 8080
        server = HTTPServer(('', port), webserverHandler)
        print "Web server running on port %s" % port
        server.serve_forever()

    except KeyboardInterrupt:

...
```
Inside our KeyboardInterrupt exception, we will shut down the server by calling **server.socket.close**, and have another print statement just letting us know that the server was properly stopped, like so:
```
...

def main():
    try:
        port = 8080
        server = HTTPServer(('', port), webserverHandler)
        print "Web server running on port %s" % port
        server.serve_forever()

      except KeyboardInterrupt:
          print "^C entered, stopping web server..."
          server.socket.close()

...
```
Above our main method, we will now define the webserverHandler class that we called in our HTTPServer, and have it extend from a class called **BaseHTTPRequestHandler**.
```
from BaseHTTPServer import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class webserverHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):

def main():

...

```
The **do_GET** function handles all get requests our web server receives. In order to figure out which resource we are trying to access, we will use a simple pattern matching plan that only looks for the ending of our URL path.

Let's create another try-except block for our do-GET method. The **BaseHTTPRequestHandler** provides us a variable called ***path*** that contains the URL sent by the client to the server as a string. We will make an if statement that looks for the URL that ends with '/hello'.

```
...

class webserverHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        try:
            if self.path.endswith("/hello"):
                self.send_response(200)
                self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')
                self.end_headers()

        except:

...

```

In this try block, we tell our web server to send a response code of **200**, indicating a successful get request.

We also use the **send_header** function to indicate that we're replying with text in
the form of HTML to our client along with an **end_headers** command, which just sends a blank line indicating the end of our HTTP headers in the response.

Now that we've created the response, we can include some content to send back to the client. Let's create an empty string named output and add a message with some HTML and body tags to it:
```
...

class webserverHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        try:
            if self.path.endswith("/hello"):
                self.send_response(200)
                self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')
                self.end_headers()

                output = ""
                output += "<html><body>Hello!</html></body>"

        except:

...
```
We can use the **self.wfile.write** function to send a message back to the client, so we'll just put our output string in it.

We'll also add a print statement for now, just so we can see our output string in the terminal. This might be handy for debugging.

Then we can exit our if statement with the **return** command.
```
...

class webserverHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        try:
            if self.path.endswith("/hello"):
                self.send_response(200)
                self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')
                self.end_headers()

                output = ""
                output += "<html><body>Hello!</html></body>"
                self.wfile.write(output)
                print output
                return

        except:

...
```
Let's also write an exception for IOErrors, like so:
```
...

class webserverHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        try:
            if self.path.endswith("/hello"):
                self.send_response(200)
                self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')
                self.end_headers()

                output = ""
                output += "<html><body>Hello!</html></body>"
                self.wfile.write(output)
                print output
                return

        except IOErrors:
            self.send_error(404, "File Not Found %s" % self.path)

...
```
This following line of code notifies us of a **404** or **"File Not Found"** error.

### Code Recap
So here's what we've written thus far:
```
from BaseHTTPServer import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class webserverHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        try:
            if self.path.endswith("/hello"):
                self.send_response(200)
                self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')
                self.end_headers()

                output = ""
                output += "<html><body>Hello!</html></body>"
                self.wfile.write(output)
                print output
                return

        except IOErrors:
            self.send_error(404, "File Not Found %s" % self.path)

def main():
    try:
        port = 8080
        server = HTTPServer(('', port), webserverHandler)
        print "Web server running on port %s" % port
        server.serve_forever()

      except KeyboardInterrupt:
          print "^C entered, stopping web server..."
          server.socket.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

Now we're ready to test it in the browser. To do so, save the webserver.py file, navigate to it from within your vagrant machine, and execute it writing `$ python webserver.py`.
