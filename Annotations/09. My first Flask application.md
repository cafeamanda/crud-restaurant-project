# My first Flask application

In this lesson, you'll create a menu app using the Flask framework.

#### Frameworks
I will start by showing you the basic components of a Flask application, with a simple hello world program, which you will then create on your own.


#### Database
Then we will connect to our database via SQL Alchemy to view all of the items in each restaurant menu.


#### Templates
Next, you will learn about templates, and how they allow you to write HTML code, separately from Python code, keeping your application more organized.


#### url_for
After that, I will introduce a special function in Flask called url_for, which builds the URLs that you will use to navigate through your new Flask application.


#### Forms
We will then create forms to capture data from users...

#### Message Flashing
... and use message flashing to notify the user each time they successfully change information in the database.

#### JSON
I will discuss a way to use **flash** to add the option to send JSON messages instead of HTML.

#### Styling
And finally, take some time to style our app with some CSS.
